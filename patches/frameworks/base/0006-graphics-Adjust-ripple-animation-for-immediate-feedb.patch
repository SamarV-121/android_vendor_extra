Subject: [PATCH 06/47] graphics: Adjust ripple animation for immediate
 feedback

Lack of immediate feedback when interacting with UI elements that use
ripple animations makes the phone feel much slower and more clunky than
it really is. Immediate touch feedback is part of why iOS feels more
responsive in many areas.

There is now a 225 ms hold time and 225 ms fading exit time to remain
timing-compatible with the original Material ripple, since many
other animations are time-synced to it.
